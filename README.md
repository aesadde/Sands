# Sands Abstract  Machine

This is an incomplete implementation of Moran and Sands' abstract machine for improvement theory in call-by-need semantics.
The abstract machine and the whole theory is described in their [1999 paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=292547&dl=ACM&coll=DL&CFID=685253895&CFTOKEN=44765828).
